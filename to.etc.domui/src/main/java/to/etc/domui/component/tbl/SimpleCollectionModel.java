/**
 * DEPRECATED Use SimpleListModel instead. The SimpleCollectionModel is a very basic model that directly represents a collection.
 *
 * <p>20091206 jal This model is deprecated because TableModel's <i>REQUIRE</i> the use of indexed addressing, and this
 * addressing needs to remain stable while using this. This implementation uses Collection and re-creates a list
 * for every time we need indexed addressing. This is VERY expensive, but also unstable when items are added: when
 * they are added to a HashSet for instance the entire internal order can change (after a rehash) causing all items
 * in the table to shift position. Although this model does fire modelChanged so at least the presentation remains
 * correct, this is unacceptable behaviour.</i>
 *
 * The implementation depends on the unshelve command, during unshelving all listeners are notified that the model changed,
 * so changes in the collection this model represents constructor will be reflected in the component that is bound to the model.
 * This means that changes made to the collection itself will be reflected only if that changed are made in a different page then
 * where the component this model is tied to is located. For reflecting changes in the same page the add and remove methods should be
 * called on the model itself, not on the collection it represents.
