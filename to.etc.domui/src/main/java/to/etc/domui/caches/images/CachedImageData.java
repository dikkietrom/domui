/**
 * Some permutation of an image that was recently used. Once created, an CachedImageData is immutable
 * and will be discarded fully when changes to it are necessary, for instance because a newer
 * version of the source is available. The immutable character means that when ImageInstances have
 * to change existing "readers" of an instance may continue to use that instance; when they are
 * done using it the garbage collector will release it's resources automatically.
 *
 * <p>An CachedImageData always contains a cachefile containing the datastream for the resource, and
 * optionally a bufferset containing a memory-cached copy. The amount of memory used by an ImageEntry
 * determines it's <i>cache load</i>, and is used to add to the cache's actual size. This is the only
 * metric used to determine that the cache is full causing LRU removal of entries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The "immutableness" of an ImageSource also extends to it's backing file in the filecache. This
 * means that different "versions" of the ImageSource need different cachefiles, and in no way may
 * an existing cachefile be "overwritten" with a different version - because clients can be reading
 * it. This means that all cachefiles for a given CachedImageData use the source's version number in
 * their filename.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because filenames are versioned we can reuse existing files on the file system when encountered.
 * This can be after a server restart where the memory cache is empty; when a resource is accessed and
 * it's cachefiles are present and valid there is no need to get them again from the db; this means that
 * only a "version number ping" is done to the db. Another way is when a resource is evicted from the
 * memory cache because the cache was full and it was the least-recently-used (LRU) object: in that
 * case the memory copy is removed but the files remain. When the object is used again it will pick
 * up it's datafiles when possible, making for speedy recovery of a cache miss.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Exceptions to the immutableness</h3>
 * <p>Although all user-required fields are immutable, this object contains some fields like the LRU
 * pointers and the cache state which are changed and maintained by the ImageCache instance itself,
 * and that change during the object's lifecycle.</p>
