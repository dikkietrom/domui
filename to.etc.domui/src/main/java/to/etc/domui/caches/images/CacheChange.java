/**
 * This is an accounting record for a cache change in progress. While individual
 * images are manipulated the main cache structures must remain unlocked, but the
 * actual load of images on the cache (their cache size in bytes) is available
 * long after they are added to the cache. To accomodate we lock the cache twice:
 * at the start of an image retrieve to obtain/create the ImageRoot, and at the
 * end of ANY action to do all of the change accounting in the cache for the
 * items that changed. When the code executing the change returns the root
 * cache is again locked and the accounting changes are done quickly.
 *
 * <h2>Locking strategy</h2>
 * This object itself is always used by <i>one</i> thread at a time; ownership passes
 * protected by locks that are not present on this object. While the data in this
 * object changes the ImageRoot object for which this data changes is locked.
