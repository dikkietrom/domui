/**
 * <p>This describes how an Object is to be shown when it is displayed in a (Data)Table (see {@link DataTable}
 * and {@link BasicRowRenderer}). The most important thing it does is to specify which properties of the
 * object should be shown in columns of the table; every property mentioned in the {@link #defaultColumns()} list
 * becomes a column in the Table shown (provided the columns are not joined). In addition, this can also specify
 * a default "sort" property; when set the table will be shown initially sorted on that property provided
 * the data model supports sorting.</p>
 *
 * <p>This annotation can be used on a class itself; then it defines the default wherever that class is used
 * in a table. You can also add it to some property in which case it "overrides" the definition done at "class"
 * level for tables that are shown using that single property. This has not yet been used so success is questionable...</p>
