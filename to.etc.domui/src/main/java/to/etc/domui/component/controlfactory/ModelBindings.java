/**
 * This represents a list of {@link IModelBinding}s. Each binding connects a UI Control
 * (the input component) with a given property of the data model. This list can be used
 * to collect all of the component-property bindings for an entire form, so that the
 * data from the model can be moved into the controls that <i>edit</i> that model in one
 * call. And of course the reverse, moving all edited control data back to the model
 * is possible too.
 * <p>A ModelBindings list is itself an IModelBinding too, so you can add this list to
 * <i>another</i> list of bindings too.
