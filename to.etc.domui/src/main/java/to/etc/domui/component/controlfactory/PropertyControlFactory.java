 * is needed this list is obtained and each ControlFactory in it has it's accepts() method called. This
 * returns a "score" for each control factory. The first factory with the highest score (which must be
 * > 0) will be used to create the control. If no factory returns a &gt; 0 score a control cannot be
 * created which usually results in an exception.
